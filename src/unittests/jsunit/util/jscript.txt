\section jsript JScript in General

<p>Microsoft's JavaScript implementation named JScript is part of the Windows
Script. This is a service offered by the Operating System. This contains a
generic engine that is able to run a lot of languages, JScript is just one
among others.  Microsoft offers in the package JScript and VBScript, other
vendors offer other languages that can be plugged into the engine. Any
application may embed the script engine and process scripts in any of the
registered languages.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/">Windows Script</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please recognize, that products using Windows Script are often delivered
with a specific version of the engine. Since it is used as a system wide
service, upgrading this engine to a newer version will also upgrade the
languages delivered with Windows Script.  Therefore even and old Internet
Explorer can use an up-to-date JScript version.</p>

<p>The JScript implementation up-to version 5.6 has an incompatible definition
of the Error class, they do not provide the Error#name and Error#message
members.  Early versions also miss the Array#push and Array#pop member
functions that are in this case provided by JsUnit.</p>

\subsection cscript Windows Script Host

<p>The Windows Script host has two utilities running scripts from
command-line: cscript and wscript. Both utilities recognize the file extension
and will run JScript files directly. wscript will execute them in a GUI
environment, while cscript is a console application running the script in the
console.</p> 

<p>JScript code can be within normal .js files or the JScript files can be
included using a Windows Script Host file (.wsf). JsUnit delivers in the
examples <i>AllTests.js</i> and <i>AllTests.wsf</i> for both variants. Such
files are also available for the unit tests of JsUnit itself.</p>

\subsection iexplore Internet Explorer

<p>The Internet Explorer's JScript capabilities are inherited from the
installed Windows Script. Therefore even an Internet Explorer 3.x may be able
to run JsUnit, if the engine was updated separately. The Internet Explorer adds
DOM objects to the JScript. The DOM is different between the various Internet
explorer versions, but independent from the JScript version.</p>

<p>Use the HTML include tag to add JsUnit to your scripts. See the file
<i>AllTests.html</i> delivered in the examples. Such a file is also available
to run the unit tests of JsUnit. You might debug every script using the
Windows Script Debugger or more advanced development tools from Microsoft.</p>

\section jsdebugging General JScript Debugging

<p>Since JScript is embedded into the Windows Script Engine, any debugger
capable of debugging this script environment can be used to debug any
application using this engine. So it is possible to debug scripts running in
the Internet Explorer and in the Windows Script Host as well as scripts
running server-side in Active Server Pages.</p>

\subsection wsdebug Windows Script Debugger

<p>The Microsoft Script Debugger is available at MSDN for download.  It can be
used to debug scripts embedded in HTML documents or for single JavaScript
files.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/downloads/list/webdev.asp">Windows Script Debugger</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To debug a script from command-line use the command-line interpreters with
the /X option:</p>

\htmlonly
<div class="fragment"><pre>
cscript /X <i>&lt;filename&gt;.js</i></pre>
</div>
\endhtmlonly

\subsection interdev Microsoft Visual InterDev

<p>Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 is a development environment for web
applications. It is very comfortable with debugging JavaScript code on client-
and server side. JsUnit contains a Visual InterDev solution (.sln) and project
(.vup) file for the unit tests and the samples. Visual InterDev is now
integrated into Visual Studio .NET</p>
