\section overview Overview

\subsection description Description

<p>JsUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests in JavaScript. It is
an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks. JsUnit is a
port of JUnit 3.8.1 originally written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck. It covers
the core system and the examples.</p>

</ul>

\subsection downloads Downloads

<p>JsUnit uses the infrastructure of SourceForge. Therefore are all downloads
are available at the of the JsUnit project page. The documentation of JsUnit
contains always release notes and the project history.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/filelist.php?group_id=158">Download section of JsUnit at SouceForge</a></li>
    <li>\ref release</li>
    <li>\ref history</li>
</ul>

<p>The JsUnit projects uses the Perl script js2doxy.pl to convert JavaScript
into pseudo C++ code, that can be used for Doxygen as input. The distribution
of JsUnit contains this script in the util directory. You may download this
script also from the CVS repository directly.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a
    href="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/jsunit/trunk/jsunit/util/js2doxy.pl?op=file">js2doxy.pl
    in Subversion</a></li>
    <li>\ref docConv</li>
</ul>

\subsection usageintro Usage

<p>The documents include a little manual how to write unit tests with JsUnit.
The coding conventions follow the guide line of Netscape. Since JUnit is based
on Java I introduced an interface mechanism used for the JsUnit realization
following a specific programming convention.</p>

<ul>
    <li>\ref codeConv</li>
    <li>\ref interface</li>
    <li>\ref writing</li>
    <li>\ref examples</li>
</ul>

<p>The distribution also includes some samples demonstrating the usage of 
JsUnit in different environments.</p>

    <li>\ref ant</li>
    <li>\ref products</li>
</ul>

\subsection people People

<p>You can e-mail me for any question, suggestion or problem. Join the JsUnit
mailing list hosted by Yahoo! Groups for more attention and share your request
and their answer with others that may be interested. Please note that more
than one JsUnit project exists. Additionally JsUnit would not have been
possible in the current from with the help of other people.</p>

\section donations Donations

<p>While JsUnit is and will be freely available, the programming effort eats
up a lot of my spare time.  I really enjoy programming, but sometimes
maintaining and developing a framework becomes also a burden, since it
prevents me sometimes from investigating in new and other technologies.
Donations will keep my delight and motivation developing JsUnit at a much
higher level.</p>

\subsection donationreasons Reasons for Donations

<p>There might be a reason for you reading at this section:</p>

    development on this framework.</li>
    <li>You are a business user contributing a fair amount of money for the
    potential large benefit (and cost savings) that your company derives from
    JsUnit development.</li>
    <li>Or, you have just some money to share :)</li>
