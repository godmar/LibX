\page maven2 Apache Maven 2

<p><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a> is a build tool from the
Apache Software Foundation generally used for Java development.  It uses a 
Project Object Model defined in a <em>pom.xml</em> file to describe the build.
Maven 2 uses a lifecycle where at each phase of this lifecycle different goals
can be attached that are provided by plugins.  The JsUnit plugin is 
automatically attached to the test <em>test</em> phase.</p>

<p>The JsUnit plugin uses \ref rhino to perform the JavaScript tests.</p>

\section m2repo The Maven 2 Repository at BerliOS

The artifacts of JsUnit and its plugin is located in the Maven 2 repository at
BerliOS.  The released versions will also be available at Maven's central
repository, but the upload procedure may cause some time gap.  The reports
generated by Maven are also available.

<ul>
	<li><a href="maven2/repo">Repository for released artifacts</a></li>
	<li><a href="maven2/snapshots">Repository for snapshots</a></li>
	<li><a href="reports/index.html">Maven Reports</a></li>
</ul>

\section m2plugin Using the Maven 2 Plugin

<p>The JsUnit Maven plugin has simply to be declared in the <em>build</em>
section with the other plugins.  As usual with Maven 2 all necessary
dependencies are automatically available.  The plugin itself is published with
groupId <em>de.berlios.jsunit</em> and artifactDi <em>jsunit-maven2-plugin</em>
in the Maven repository of JsUnit at BerliOS and in Maven's central repository
also.</p>

<p>The configuration section of the plugin has following elements:</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
    <td><b>Name</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
    <td><b>Default</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>printSummary</td>
    <td>A flag to enable a summary for the performed unit tests.</td>
    <td>${maven.test.skip}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>reportsDirectory</td>
    <td>The directory where the plugin writes the results of the unit tests.</td>
    <td>${project.build.directory}/surefire-reports</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>skip</td>
    <td>A flag to skip the JavaScript unit tests completely.</td>
    <td>${maven.test.skip}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>skipExec</td>
    <td>A flag to skip the execution of the JavaScript unit tests, but the 
    JavaScript code is still loaded into the JavaScript engine to detect
    possible syntax problems.</td>
    <td>${maven.test.skip.exec}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>sourceDirectory</td>
    <td>The root directory for the JavaScript sources.  All <em>source</em>
    declarations are relative to this setting.</td>
    <td>${basedir}/src/main/webapp/js</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>sources</td>
    <td>An array of <em>source</em> elements.  Each element contains a name to
    a JavaScript source file (relative to the path given in 
    <em>sourceDirectory</em>).  The sequence of the <em>source</em> elements
    define the sequence the files are loaded into the JavaScript engine.</td>
    <td>${basedir}/src/main/webapp/js</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>testFailureIgnore</td>
    <td>A flag to allow the current build to continue ignoring possible test
    failures.</td>
    <td>${maven.test.failure.ignore}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>testSourceDirectory</td>
    <td>The root directory for the JavaScript unit test sources.  All

</tr>
<tr>
    <td>testSuites</td>
    <td>An array of <em>testSuite</em> elements.</td>

    <td><b>Description</b></td>
    <td><b>Default</b></td>

    pattern with a name relative to the <em>testSourceDirectory</em> element.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>The name of the test suite.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>The type of the test suite, one of the following values:
		<dl>
 			<dt>ALLTESTS</dt>
 			<dd>Looks for a class AllTests derived from TestSuite and runs its suite.</dd>
 			<dt>TESTSUITES</dt>
 			<dd>Looks for all classes ending with TestSuite and that are derived from TestSuite and run their suites.</dd>
 			<dt>TESTCASES</dt>
 			<dd>Looks for all classes ending with TestCase and that are derived from TestCase and runs them (the default).</dd>
