Build instructions:


Firefox:

LibX for Firefox can be built using the following:

    ./xcreateextension.pl

The Firefox build script requires spock for extension signing.  This is
available at: 

    https://github.com/bard/spock


Chrome:

LibX for Chrome can be built using the following:

    ./buildgc.pl

The Chrome build script requires crxmake.  This is available at:

    https://github.com/Constellation/crxmake


If run on libx.org, this script will build, sign, and publish the extension.
Signing is only required if publishing the extension for other users.  If
building locally, specify the -localbuild argument.  The localbuild argument
can be specified to build a test version.  With this argument, the script will
not sign the extension or modify the update manifest file.  Example:
./xcreateextension.pl -localbuild test
