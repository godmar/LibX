To create a new edition, you must create a new directory in here first.

Let's say you want to create an edition for Academic University, acu

You create a directory:

# mkdir acu
# cd acu

Then, copy into this directory the following files:

# cp ../vt/config .
# cp ../vt/files .

Then, get a small logo (http://yourlibrary.edu/favicon.ico works really well)
that shows well at 16x16 and get a large logo and copy those into the acu directory. 
See footnote 1.
.gif, .jpg, .png, .ico all seem to work.

# wget http://yourlibrary.edu/yourimage/smalllogo.gif
# wget http://yourlibrary.edu/yourimage/largelogo.jpg

Next, edit files and replace the last two lines:
Replace shield50.gif with the filename of your large logo.
Replace virginiatech.ico with the filename of your small logo.

Adapt all entries in acu/config as needed.
(If you don't have openurl support or ezproxy support, set the variables to empty, 
as in proxytype=        )

Finally, run

# cd ..
# ./createextension.pl acu

acu/libx-acu.xpi will have your extension for installation.


-------------------
The following files control customization:

config 
------
    sets a list of variables key=value, one per line. 
    All files in the base subdirectory will be copied into the xpi 
    All occurrences of $key$ will be replaced with value.  


files
------
    consists of a list of files that need to be copied into the xpi file.
    Each entry is of the form file destination-directory-relative-to-top
    Those files will ALSO be subject to config substitution from config files.


ONLY if hosted at libx.org:
After running "createextension.pl", the files can be made "live" by copying
them to the libx.org editions directory (ONLY if hosted at libx.org)
See makelive.sh for what's being copied.
Adjust createextension.pl if you want to host your edition yourself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The libx.org/editions directory contains the editions hosted at libx.org.
Each edition is in a subdirectory, for instance libx.org/editions/vt/
hosts the VT edition.  

Each hosted edition must contain the .xpi file, the update.rdf files, and, optionally, 
a libx.html file.

The libx.html can alternatively be made part of the library's home site so the
offering will appear to come directly from the offering library.

Footnote 1:

Ideally is a so-called multiresolution icon that contains a 16x16 and a 48x48 image.
Note that the 48x48 does not replace the large logo for LibX.
The 48x48-stretched version is displayed when the user clicks "Tools -> Extensions".

Multiresolution icon files are a single .ico file that is a container for the different resolution.
A free program to create those can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/geniconxp/
Notice that the installation is somewhat screwy, but it works:
You have to first install 'ImageMagick-6.1.6-Q16-windows-dll.exe', during installation
check option 'Install ImageMagickobject control'
Then install GenIconXP and ignore the registration error.
ImageMagick can be downloaded here:
