To create a new edition, you must create a new directory in here first.

If you create a directory called 'vt', then run "createextension.pl vt" and
you'll get libx-vt.xpi

In that directory 'vt', the following files control customization:

config 
------
    sets a list of variables key=value, one per line. 
    All files in the base subdirectory will be copied into the xpi 
    All occurrences of $key$ will be replaced with value.  


files
------
    consists of a list of files that need to be copied into the xpi file.
    Each entry is of the form file destination-directory-relative-to-top
    Those files will ALSO be subject to config substitution from config files.


After running "createextension.pl", the files can be made "live" by copying
them to the libx.org editions directory (if hosted at libx.org)
See makelive.sh for what's being copied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The libx.org/editions directory contains the editions hosted at libx.org.
Each edition is in a subdirectory, for instance libx.org/editions/vt/
hosts the VT edition.  

Each hosted edition must contain the .xpi file, the update.rdf files, and, optionally, 
a libx.html file.

The libx.html can alternatively be made part of the library's home site so the
offering will appear to come directly from the offering library.
