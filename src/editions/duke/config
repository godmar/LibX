# No slash at the end.

# If you look at pg2 of http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/deeplinking/openworldcat_deeplinking.pdf

# We send along an element "sid=libxvt" with our query - if your OPAC software allows,

# OpenURL resolver
#
# OpenURL resolver type
# Possible values: sersol, webbridge, generic
#
# Note: fundamentally, OpenURL resolver do the same thing:
# they try to find/link to a resource given the meta tags in the URL
# However, some have quirks: for instance, sersol currently barks if you don't
# specify at least an issn or title meta tag.  Being able to account for such
# minor differences is the only reason to support multiple types here.
# generic and webbridge do the same thing.
#
# Leave empty if you do not wish OpenURL support
#
openurltype=generic

# Base URL of your OpenURL resolver
# include an ending slash here if necessary
# Examples:
# SFX: openurlresolverurl=http://orion.galib.uga.edu/sfx_git1
# SerSol: openurlresolverurl=http://zr2yp8gq5s.search.serialssolutions.com/
# WebBridge: openurlresolverurl=http://www.library.lafayette.edu:4550/resserv

#
# The 'sid' used by libx.
# This is put in the 'sid=...' part of the OpenURL request.
# It must be something that the resolver accepts.
# It should be something the resolver keeps separate statistics for.
#
# Some resolvers (WB) are very strict about which sid's (also called "Origins" or "Sources")
# they allow.  For those, either add libx as a vendor or pick a sid here that the resolver
# understands.

# Should we hijack and rewrite OpenURLs displayed on the Google Scholar page?
# If your library is registered with Scholar, this will simply turn your links into cues 
# If your library is not registered with Scholar, *and* you set preferences in Scholar
# to display results for a library (e.g. Harvard) that is registered, those links
# will be turned into cues that are redirected to your own OpenURL resolver.
