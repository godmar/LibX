#
# LibX now supports multiple catalogs.
# The first one is called the primary catalog.
# The others are called secondary catalogs

# Begin of definitions for primary catalog

#
# The catalogtype.
# It must be one of millenium, horizon, aleph, or voyager.
# For millenium, you must give a $catalog.searchscope, see below.
#
# For aleph, you will need to specify the following properties also:
#
#       $aleph.localbase=duk01  
#               this property must refer to your "localbase"
#               the example here refers to Duke University's. You must change it.
#
#       The remaining properties depend on the names of local indices:
#
#       $aleph.title=TIT
#       $aleph.author=WAU
#       $aleph.isbn=ISBN
#       $aleph.issn=ISSN
#       $aleph.callno=CNA
#       $aleph.keyword=WRD
#       $aleph.findfunc=find-b
#       $aleph.advfindfunc=find-a
#       $aleph.scanfunc=scan
#
#       aleph knows about "scan" (heading indexes) and "find" (straight keyword) indices. 
#       By default, title & call number use scan, all others use find.
#       Use a ; separated list to change that.  The codes are
#       'i' - ISBN, 'is' - ISSN, 'a' - author, 't' - title, 'Y' - keyword, 'c' - call number
#       In this example, title, call number, and author would be searched using scan.
#       $aleph.scan.index.list=t;c;a

#
# horizon and voyager usually operate with the default settings.
#
$catalog.type=millenium
# legacy note: used to be catalogtype=millenium

# Name of the catalog - used in many places.
$catalog.name=Addison

# The base URL of the catalog
# >>> No slash at the end. <<<
# Do not include any path here.
# If you look at pg2 of http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/open/deeplinking/openworldcat_deeplinking.pdf
# you need to put the library_opac_baseURL here
#
# For aleph, do not include a trailing /F here.
#
$catalog.url=http://addison.vt.edu
# legacy: used to be catalogurl

#
# A regular expression that would match page displayed by the OPAC
# This is currently only used in the VT edition to insert links to
# floor maps, otherwise it is ignored.
#
$catalog.urlregexp=addison\.vt\.edu
# legacy: used to be catalogregexp=
# will be phased out

#
# We send along an element "sid=libxvt" with our query - if your OPAC software allows,
# you could identify queries originating from LibX in this way.
# Millenium, it appears, does not do this so this option currently has no effect here.
#
$catalog.sid=libxvt
# legacy: used to be catalogsid=

#
# [Millenium only]
# Some catalogs allow searches over multiple scopes, such as "All Libraries", "Law Library Only", 
# "Vet Library" only etc.
# These are search scopes.
#
# At VT, scope 1 means all
# If unknown, use "1".
$catalog.searchscope=1

# Use this to sort the millenium results differently
# $millenium.sort=A

# Many installations prefer the "X" code for a keyword search in Millenium
# $millenium.keywordcode=X

# A secondary catalog can be defined like so:
# 
#    $catalog1.catalog.type=millenium
#    $catalog1.catalog.name=Connect NY
#    $catalog1.catalog.url=http://connectny.info
#    $catalog1.catalog.sid=libxvt
#    $catalog1.catalog.searchscope=1
#    $catalog1.millenium.sort=
#
# and so on ($catalog2., $catalog3., ...)
# The search is not a meta-search, it's additional options in the drop-down box.

# Should we place ISBN-based links to point to OCLC's xISBN service?
# Set this if you want that, omit if not
$cues.use.xisbn=true

# To make xISBN more robust, you should have OCLC assign an xISBN bookmark OAI for you.
# Go to http://alcme.oclc.org/bookmarks/ and either look for your identifier
# if you already have one, or sign up for one.  Specify the entire identifier.
# Example:
# $catalog.xisbn.oai=oai:bookmarks.oclc.org:library.mit.edu

# OpenURL resolver
#
# OpenURL resolver type
# Possible values: sersol, webbridge, generic, sfx
#
# Note: fundamentally, OpenURL resolvers do the same thing:
# they try to find/link to a resource given the meta tags in the URL
# However, some have quirks: for instance, sersol currently barks if you don't
# specify at least an issn or title meta tag.  Being able to account for such
# minor differences is the only reason to support multiple types here.
# generic and webbridge do the same thing.
#
# sersol and sfx support searches by journal title if set up so.
#
# Leave empty if you do not wish OpenURL support
#
openurltype=sersol

# Base URL of your OpenURL resolver
# include an ending slash here if necessary
# Examples:
#
# No ending slash:
# SFX: openurlresolverurl=http://orion.galib.uga.edu/sfx_git1   
# WebBridge: openurlresolverurl=http://www.library.lafayette.edu:4550/resserv
#
# Needs an ending slash:
# SerSol: openurlresolverurl=http://zr2yp8gq5s.search.serialssolutions.com/
# Sirsi: openurlresolverurl=http://bucknell-resolver.sirsi.net/
#

openurlresolverurl=http://su8bj7jh4j.search.serialssolutions.com/

#
# The 'sid' used by libx.
# This is put in the 'sid=...' part of the OpenURL request.
# It must be something that the resolver accepts.
# It should be something the resolver keeps separate statistics for.
#
# Some resolvers (WB) are very strict about which sid's (also called "Origins" or "Sources")
# they allow.  For those, either add libx as a vendor or pick a sid here that the resolver
# understands.

# Off-campus proxying.

# Leave empty if not used.

#
# How to rewrite URLs for proxying.  
# For ezproxy, the "%S" is replaced with the URL that should be proxied.
# For wam, provide the hostname for which DNS catch-all is enabled
#        (typically identical to catalogurl without http, as in addison.vt.edu)

#
# Should we hijack and rewrite OpenURLs displayed on the Google Scholar page?
# If your library is registered with Scholar, this will simply turn your links into cues 
# If your library is not registered with Scholar, *and* you set preferences in Scholar
# to display results for a library (e.g. Stanford) that IS registered, those links
# will be turned into cues that are redirected to your own OpenURL resolver.

# If hosted on libx.org, the edition homepage should be

# We put a redirect for libx.html either to an external page
