genhash.pl needs to be run whenever a file in this bootstrapped directory has
changed.  genhash.pl generates updates.json, a JSON file that is used by the
object cache to determine whether files have changed.  updates.json is also used
to validate bootstrapped files before they are saved to the object cache.
