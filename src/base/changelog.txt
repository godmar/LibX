To Do List
---------

Short Term:

Mid Term:
 *if article finder didn't find journal title; 
  add "do you mean" functionality to open url resolver page
 *if only a title is given in the openurl resolver, should we use sersol's journal finder instead?
 *create testpage with links
 *support catalog types that require POST
 *support catalog types that use sessions (e.g., Sirsi)

 *if sersol result page doesn't show article link even though a DOI is given, add one.
